# PublicBits

Data distribution for individuals and communities.

Users register data (small or Big) with PublicBits, which will publish that metadata, including a link to the original data, for public benefit. We will automatically register data from hundreds of available data portals. PublicBits users may offer their unused bandwidth to mirror their previously-downloaded datasets for others, as a public service. If the original source goes offline, the data will still be downloadable. PublicBits.org brings structure to sharing data, making it easy to find, manage, and re-use the data you use every day.
