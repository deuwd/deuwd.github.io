# Road Trip to Chikmangalur
by Utkarsh

We booked an innova as transportation. All of us being lazy we started around 7am. Soon the buildings and traffic of bangalore faded away
and got replaced with serene view of coconut trees and distant farms. We reached Belur around 1:00 pm. It was a very small town famous only for
Chennakeshava Temple, it almost took 100 years to build and craft sculptures.
Self imposed guide described various stories around the carved godesses and a fine description of ornaments and dresses wore by woman of 1100 CE (approx).

We reached chikmangalur soon enough after belur had lunch at giri-inn and reached the resort before eve. I was greeted by a small brown female dog.



Most of the resorts are located near by Coffee Plantations
and also serve as a home for estate owners. Our host raghu had been living here for past 25 years with family. We put down our bags 
had freshly prepared coffee (probably the best i had ever). Later raghu told both milk and coffee were from his estate only. 


We left for mulyangiri peak https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullayanagiri which was about 8-10 kms from homestay. Things went foggy after some altitude and ravi(driver) has to speed down. We Reached the peak finally and hit by cold strong winds as soon as we got out of car. It was not raining but clouds and winds were enough to get you drenched. We took some pics and got back to homestay greeted by awesome coffee again.
Dinner was homemade delicious malad food with soft rice balls and bean curry. 

Next day we trekked our way up to waterfall near the resort but the water was muddy due to rains. We decided to eat a dosa at New Town Canteen and called it off. We managed to reach bangalore by 9 pm and hence our chillaxed trip came to end finally.
